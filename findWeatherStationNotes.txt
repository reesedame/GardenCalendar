FIND CLOSEST WEATHER STATION
~ Notes based on Hus' way of finding a user's closest weather station based on zip code ~

Files:
    * main.py
    * weather_stations.csv
    * zipcodes.csv

Steps:
    * User provides zip code
    * pandas reads zipcodes.csv
    * User zip code is matched to zip code in zipcodes.csv
    * Latitude and longitude of zip code is then saved
    * pandas reads weather_stations.csv
    * cdist (from scipy.spatial.distance) is used to calculate "closest" latitude & longitude to determine a station_id from weather_stations.csv
